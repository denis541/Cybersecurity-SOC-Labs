The "Modular Analyst" Workflow
You can master the functions of Security Onion without the weight of Security Onion. Here is how you split the functions:
1. Focus: Network Attacks (The "Suricata" Phase)
The Goal: Detect Nmap scans or malicious traffic.
The "Lite" Method: Run your Kali/Parrot VM and your Host. Use Wireshark on your host to capture the "attack" traffic.
What you skip: Data integrity. You are focusing purely on the "Wire."
2. Focus: Data Integrity (The "Wazuh" Phase)
The Goal: Detect if a file was changed (FIM).
The "Lite" Method: Run your Windows 10 VM and your Splunk Host. Run your PowerShell hashing script or Sysmon.
What you skip: Network scanning. You are focusing purely on the "Disk."
3. Focus: Log Analysis (The "Elastic/Splunk" Phase)
The Goal: Searching and correlating.
The "Lite" Method: Turn off all VMs. Just run Splunk on your host and analyze the data you collected in the previous steps.
What you skip: Real-time generation. You are focusing purely on the "Intelligence."
Organize your GitHub/CV by "Tactics"
When you document your work, group your findings under the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics:
Persistence: "I monitored registry keys for T1547.001 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution)."
Defense Evasion: "I used file hashing to detect T1222 (File and Directory Permissions Modification)."
Discovery: "I used network logs to alert on T1046 (Network Service Discovery)."
"I used the MITRE ATT&CK framework to structure my lab work. I focused on techniques like File Hashing (T1070.006) to ensure I had the right telemetry in my Splunk instance, which validated my ability to detect evidence tampering."

Security Operations & Engineering
SIEM Implementation: Deployed and managed a Splunk Enterprise environment to aggregate telemetry from Windows and Linux endpoints.
Threat Detection: Developed custom Sysmon configurations and PowerShell scripts to perform File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) via SHA-256 hashing.
Adversary Emulation: Validated defensive visibility by executing Atomic Red Team tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
Analysis & Reporting: Created automated dashboards and alerts to monitor for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and network anomalies.
