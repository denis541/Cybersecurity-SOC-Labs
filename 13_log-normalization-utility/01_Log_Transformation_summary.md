Log Transformation Technical Summary
Working Directory: /home/analyst/lab.support.files/
Target File: applicationX_in_epoch.log
1. Command Breakdown
cd /home/analyst/lab.support.files/
Purpose: Changes the current working directory to the location of the log files.
ls -l
Purpose: Lists files in long format to verify permissions, size, and existence before processing.
awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS="|"} {$3=strftime("%c",$3)} {print}' applicationX_in_epoch.log
awk: Invokes the pattern scanning and processing language.
BEGIN {FS=OFS="|"}: Sets both the input Field Separator and Output Field Separator to the pipe character (|).
$3=strftime("%c",$3): Targets the 3rd column (the Epoch timestamp) and transforms it into a human-readable date format using the system's locale.
{print}: Outputs the modified line to the terminal.
2. Log Cleanup & Normalization
Issue Identified:
The original log contained a trailing empty line. When processed by AWK, this null value was interpreted as 0, resulting in the Unix Epoch start date: Wed 31 Dec 1969.
Resolution:
nano applicationX_in_epoch.log: Opens the file in a text editor to manually remove the trailing newline.
Verification: Running the AWK command again ensures the 1969 artifact is removed.
3. Data Persistence
awk '...' applicationX_in_epoch.log > applicationX_in_human.log
Operation: Output Redirection.
Result: Instead of printing to the terminal (STDOUT), the processed data is saved into a new file named applicationX_in_human.log.
cat applicationX_in_human.log
Purpose: Displays the contents of the newly created file to verify successful transformation and formatting.
