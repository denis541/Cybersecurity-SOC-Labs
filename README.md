### Case Study 1: Endpoint Compromise Analysis

**Scenario:**  
Investigation of a Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT) infection impacting multiple enterprise endpoints.

**Key Findings:**
- Identified malicious persistence mechanisms implemented through Windows Registry `Run` keys.
- Mapped recurring network beaconing activity to external command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
- Recovered staged malware payloads from temporary directories, confirming multi-stage execution.
- Documented attempted lateral movement activity leveraging SMB-based techniques.

### Case Study 2: Data Exfiltration Investigation

**Scenario:**  
Analysis of unauthorized FTP-based transfer of sensitive data from internal systems.

**Key Findings:**
- Correlated user authentication events with outbound FTP transfer activity.
- Identified data staging behavior prior to exfiltration.
- Quantified the volume and sensitivity of data exfiltrated from the environment.
- Established attacker dwell time through timeline reconstruction and log correlation.

### Case Study 3: Web Application Compromise

**Scenario:**  
Investigation of a SQL injection attack resulting in unauthorized database access and credential exposure.

**Key Findings:**
- Traced injection payloads through web server and application logs.
- Identified anomalous database queries indicative of exploitation activity.
- Mapped attacker reconnaissance and enumeration behavior.
- Documented credential access and subsequent privilege escalation attempts.
