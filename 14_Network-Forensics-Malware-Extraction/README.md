# Network Forensics & Data Normalization Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a technical walkthrough of incident response procedures involving raw log transformation and binary extraction from network traffic. The goal was to convert machine-readable telemetry into analyst-ready data and recover a malicious payload from a packet capture (PCAP).
## Phase 1: Log Normalization (SIEM Readiness)
In this phase, raw application logs containing Unix Epoch timestamps were transformed into a human-readable format to facilitate timeline analysis.
Source File: applicationX_in_epoch.log
Transformation Logic: Utilized awk to redefine field separators (|) and pass the third column through the strftime function.
Issue Resolution: Identified and corrected a "Null/Zero" timestamp error (Dec 31 1969) caused by a trailing newline in the source file using the nano editor.
## Core Command:
```bash
awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS="|"} {$3=strftime("%c",$3)} {print}' applicationX_in_epoch.log
```
## Phase 2: PCAP Carving & Artifact Recovery
This phase involved inspecting a network capture of a malware download event and reconstructing the file from the TCP stream.
Traffic Analysis: Inspected nimda.download.pcap using Wireshark. Identified an HTTP GET request for a suspicious executable.
Object Extraction: Reconstructed the binary payload via Export Objects > HTTP.
Artifact Verification: Validated the file using the Linux File Utility to confirm the headers matched a Windows PE32+ executable.
## Key Findings:
  * Source IP: 209.165.200.235
  * Destination IP: 209.165.202.133
  * File Identified: W32.Nimda.Amm.exe (Verified as an x86-64 console application).
